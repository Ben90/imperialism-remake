Setting
************************

* 4 *turns* per year (seasons), earliest start 1814, usual end 1914 (400 turns) but the game continues running if players want to
* *Great powers* (GP) and *Minor nations* (MN); defines their behavior as AI; players can however choose to play any nation;  playing a MN is not recommended though
* Limit of 10 GP and 20 MN per game

Map and Terrain
=============================

* Map: *staggered layout* (every second row is shifted by half a tile, so every tile has six neighbours: NW, W, SW, SE, E, NE) and no wrapping of the map
* Only a few basic terrain types: desert, plain, swamp, jungle, hills, mountains, tundra, coastal sea, ocean
* The water area on a map must be connected, i.e. each sea tile must have a connection to each other sea tile. This means: no inland sea. This is follows from: trade by sea only and to simplify warfare at sea.
