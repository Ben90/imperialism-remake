Coding
**************

.. note:: Currently only as unordered list. Improve (regarding contribution and origin of material).

* Each (significant) submission will be reviewed by another team member who might modify it further.
* Tests have to be programmed for all major parts. Tests have to be performed regularly. 
* Code that syntax errors should never be submitted.
* Doc comments have to be added for all methods / classes / modules at submission level. At the latest when the code has matured extensive documentation is a must.
* Always add the GPLv3+ header to new files. Also add name and creation year. They indicate your consent to the open source license.
* Task driven development with short tasks is preferred.
* If chats are conducted, the log will be archived online. Any private information will be deleted before.
* Everything is conducted in the most simple and straightforward way. If a well supported/mature library is available, which is not too complex or overpowered on it's own, we will always prefer it to coding self.
* Minor tasks will have minor priority. Top priority is always to make the game running, everything else comes later.
* We will not sacrifice clarity for a fast hack. A hack that works somehow but cannot be sufficiently explained or a hack that requires cumbersome or unmotivated modifications should be rejected and the code should be redesigned instead.

 Notes
 ==================

 * Do not import QtWebEngineWidgets before importing QtCore, app will not exit properly on Windows with PyQt5
